    About me.
</h1>
<h3>
    Hi I'm zelrakker I'm stright male and i will talk about my self here,
    so i was a person that really like to drawing and create comic in school
    but since my friend is moved out i have nothing left, he was only person WHO like to watch object show just like me,
    in school i have only 1 friend who can accept me as a Best friend
    i didnt have a friend that can still watch me doing stuff like draw and animating or even watching object show.
    i still have his discord though but he online so often
    also
    about my animation journey, i was started to know how to animate in 2018
    but that time i still have only one phone so i started animate in flipaclip
    it went so good at that time i was really proud of it until i got my first ever computer in 2020 that i still use it to these day
    welp... at first i dont have an adobe animate in my computer until 2021, that time that i got adobe animate i still use my phone to animate as my main device
    cause i need to learn more about how to use adobe animate **in that time**
    my original name was "selrakker" but i change to "ZelRakker" cause the new name will gave me more of noticeable.
    if you seach up my old name you would see a bunch of stuff that i gain and make, before i got demonetized from youtube.
    that's why i create my new channel and also i was an among us animator before moved into object community.
    thanks for visiting this website!
